Decks for CPA at seneca college, here there be flash cards!

So yeah!

Anki Deck Guide:
1. Start with important definitions for the week or for what ever your covering.
2. Try to keep things concise and foot note all of your cards to actual notes for further reading.
3. Once we get the dictionary down we can add exercises into the cards for a bit extra (once again we gotta link that to something)
4. Keep things precise and clear. We don't need a mystical zen riddle in our decks.
5. DON'T MIX COURSES IN DECKS! Here at CPA Winners we pride ourselves on organization.

  Clear simple concise question
  
Back
  Clear simple concise answer
  (reference to notes)

Anything to big to fit onto a card just add a note reference. Sadly not everything we learn can be summarized on a single flash 
card.

Also this might just be a me problem but no drunk additions.

Anyone else have any ideas on important and useful things to add to the deck guide (readme) just make a pull on the master. This
will always be deployable lol.
